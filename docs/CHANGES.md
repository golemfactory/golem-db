# Golem DB Design — Change Register

Single place where the three reviews of `golem-db-design.md` (revision `3748e29`, tag
`design-review-2026-09-24`) converge. The reviews are evidence and are not edited; this register
is the working record.

**Evidence** (outside this repository, in `warburg-workspace/`):

| Review | Lens | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Rubric (`R#`) | Structure vs. the best database design documents | `review/golem-db-design-vs-design-doc-rubric.md` |
| Fable (`F-…`) | Seven reader personas, comprehension | `personas/fable/persona-review-golem-db-design.md` |
| Astra (`A-D##`) | Six reader personas, conformance and correctness, checks C1–C7 | `personas/astra/astra_review_golem-db-design.md` |
| Programme | Consolidation and plan | `review/golem-db-design-change-programme.md` |

## How rows move

- **Kinds.** K1 fix (answer already implied by the doc; PR). K2 spec decision (`[D]` issue,
  decision-log entry, then spec PR). K3 structure (one shape decision, then mechanical moves).
  K4 product (product owner decides; decision-log entry tagged `product`).
- **Statuses.** `proposed → triaged → accepted | rejected | deferred → done`. K2 rows pass through
  `waiting_on_additional_input` between the write-up in `decisions_for_architect.md` and the
  architect's choice. A row is `done` when
  its acceptance check is satisfied, not when text has been edited.
- **Priority.** P1 blocks freezing the affected mechanism as a contract; P2 blocks integration or
  adoption decisions; P3 navigation and onboarding.
- One spec PR touches one row (K1 rows may be grouped, at most five per PR, one hunk per row).
  Interface changes carry `[API]` in the PR title. Bytes are agreed by fixture in
  `conformance/vectors/`, not by prose. Nobody writes "settled" until Phase 5 of the programme.
- K2 rows are worked in two rounds. Round 1 writes the decision up in
  [decisions_for_architect.md](decisions_for_architect.md) — question, alternatives,
  recommendation, rationale, closing fixture — for the architect and any external reviewer to judge
  from that file alone. Round 2, after the decision is recorded there, lands the spec text.
- **Layout.** Open rows are grouped by who acts next; each keeps its kind (K1–K4) and full
  columns. A row moves to **Closed** when it reaches `done`, `rejected` or `deferred`: `done`
  rows are kept compact (ID, kind, change, sources, how it closed, where it landed); `deferred`
  rows keep their full columns, since they come back. Priority and PR group of closed rows are in
  git history.

### Decisions for the architect

Kind K2.

Tracks: **Q** query · **L** lifecycle · **H** history, retention, proofs · **E** encoding · **M** metering and assumptions.

Dependencies on K4: the cross-store halves of D03 and D04 wait on P05; D05, D06 and D12 wait on P06;
D18 waits on P07. D09 closes only once the vector format (implementation plan issue 45) exists. If
P05 drops segments from v1, F03, F10 and D17 are deferred with §11.

Status **wai** means "waiting on additional input".

| ID | Status | Pri | Trk | Decision needed | Sources | Acceptance check | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D01 | wai | P1 | Q | Filter evaluation: predicate combination (conjunction only / ordered DNF / negation / match-all), bounds on groups, predicates, nesting; cost shape; whether a negated literal matches records where the cell is absent or of another type (1.5: MongoDB vs SQL semantics). New section between §5 and §12 | F-A1, F-Ariadne, R10 | Section exists; Epic 8 builds from it | decisions_for_architect.md D01 (API already fixes ordered DNF; recommends: caps in `#params`, flat DNF only — `[API]` strike "nesting", canonical cost with region pruning; negation and match-all via a live-set index term if P08 = yes (1.1-B/1.2-B), else ANDNOT within a group and no match-all; 1.5: MongoDB-style negation, unless the live DSL is SQL-style and P08 requires exact compatibility) |
| D02 | wai | P1 | L | `rewind(to)`: **2.1 decided: not in v1** (confirmed 2026-09-30; API and design updated, F30). Still to decide, so the feature can be enabled later without a contract change: what it undoes (cells, index, tries, history, `#roots`, segments); ordering across MDBX and segments; invalidation of handles, cursors, caches; commit identity after rewind | F-A4, A-D06, R12 | Trace: rewind to 99, commit new 100, no stale cache or handle survives | decisions_for_architect.md D04·D03·D02 (revised per requirements OQ4: semantics specified now, feature deployment-optional and not in v1; undo by change-set replay one txn per commit, MDBX then segments; root-based identity for cursors/`at`, new `Stale` error) |
| D03 | wai | P1 | L | Crash recovery: restart from `Superblock` head; segment truncation; behaviour on segment-fsync or MDBX-write failure; retry idempotence; issued receipts | A-D06, F-Argus6, R12, R22 | Failure table: crash point × detection × recovery | decisions_for_architect.md D04·D03·D02 (restart procedure; failure-point table; deterministic vs environmental errors, new `Io`) |
| D04 | wai | P1 | L | Concurrency contract: one MDBX read snapshot per branch and per query; guard critical section vs. segment appends; arbitration of two sealed candidates | A-D06, Epic 8 | Interleaving trace: no mixed states; losing candidate leaves no durable row | decisions_for_architect.md D04·D03·D02 (recommends: one read txn per operation with head check inside it; commit mutex covering guard → segment fsync → MDBX txn) |
| D05 | wai | P1 | H | Retention and historical discovery. **Decided with P06 (2026-10-01):** the minimum window is `#minRetention` (`u64`, commits) in `#params`, and the consensus path refuses beyond it on every node. Still open: retained structures per read class; earliest supported commit; reader/cursor protection from GC; `Pruned` vs `NotFound`; discovery of deleted terms and cell names at T; where a shard's starting mark `mark(S−1)` survives once the previous system-segment shard is pruned (from F03) | A-D07, F-A4/Hermes, R24 | Service matrix; trace across retention boundary yields correct or `Pruned`, never silent empty | decisions_for_architect.md #7 (revised per CS-5/DI-7: service matrix; `#minRetention` instance parameter, consensus path refuses beyond it on every node, longer retention via a separate archival surface; GC roots = `#roots` in window; discovery via history tables; no cursor lease; snapshot-synced node exempt for one window) |
| D06 | wai | P1 | H | Proof scope and non-inclusion witness: proven classes; how the server obtains a mismatching virtual leaf's tagged value at head and historically; cost | A-D04, R verifiability | Four traced proofs (missing slot, prefix mismatch, mismatching leaf, singleton root) plus historical deleted case | decisions_for_architect.md #8 (recommends nested leaf preimage + stored `leaf_value_hashes`; range completeness a non-goal) |
| D07 | wai | P1 | L | Branch transitions: delete visibility over real overlay values; "net diff" with restored/no-op entries; history of cancelled changes; create-then-delete in one commit | A-D05 | State inventory per mutation; trace patch→delete→get, delete→rollback, write-back-to-original, seal, reopen | decisions_for_architect.md D07 (recommends: drop deleted-record set, tombstone every cell; three-valued pre-image; net diff = entries ≠ origin) |
| D09 | wai | P1 | E | Normative encoding profile: Roaring version, container selection and run-opt rule; odd-nibble padding; `EMPTY_ROOT`; `typeTag` for reserved layouts; absent pre-image encoding; `bool` byte forms; shipped type-id map; cross-table key caps | A-D02, R26 | Vectors for each item; decoder rejects non-canonical forms | decisions_for_architect.md #9 (13 items pinned; 10 vector sets) |
| D10 | wai | P2 | M | Metering shape (one paragraph) and activation semantics at `A`; minimum install→activation window; behaviour on incomplete weights | F-B9, A-D09, R16 | Timeline install, A−1, A, A+1 with schedule used and `priced_at` | decisions_for_architect.md #11 (import API contract; price by target commit; `#minActivationDelay`; check at install) |
| D11 | wai | P2 | M | Cursor contract: cursor in the receipt? `machineId` determinism; fingerprint scope (same-sequence vs same-query, expressed as an exclusion — from the §13 Open box); cursor + offset + `at` precedence | F-Argus2/Hermes, §13 open | API text; determinism statement | decisions_for_architect.md #13 (deterministic cursor, `machineId` out; same-sequence exclusion list; strict precedence) |
| D12 | wai | P2 | H | Live paging guarantee narrowed to position-shift anomalies; membership and projection may change; does a pinned cursor lease retention? | A-D10 | Text plus three-record counterexample | decisions_for_architect.md #14 (narrow the claim; no lease) |
| D13 | wai | P2 | M | Environment assumptions: MDBX durability/fsync model; who owns RAM caps (overlays, undo logs, sealed candidates, staged rows, warm sequences) | R3, A-D11/Elena | Assumptions section exists; every "bounded by RAM" cites it | decisions_for_architect.md #10 (`SYNC_DURABLE`; no node-local caps on the consensus path; memory formula) |
| D14 | wai | P2 | M | Cost qualifications: sort = N fetches + O(N log N) comparisons; warm cache holds keys or refetches; history-bitmap growth from architecture §10 | A-D11 | Table of quantities: stated vs. qualified | decisions_for_architect.md #12 |
| D15 | wai | P3 | L | Stale handle: `Conflict` on commit vs `HandleInvalid` elsewhere — intentional? | F-Heph | One sentence | decisions_for_architect.md #16 (recommends one error, `HandleInvalid`) |
| D16 | wai | P3 | L | Refuse a second consecutive `rollback()`? If yes, three texts change: the design's "`rollback()` is not idempotent" note, the Figure 11 caption (F26), and the API's "repeatable" | §10 open | API decision | decisions_for_architect.md #17 (recommends: rollback on an empty frame is an error) |
| D17 | wai | P3 | E | Typed columns in segments? (full argument carried in design.md Open Questions, from the §11 Open box) | §11 open | Decision-log entry | decisions_for_architect.md #18 (recommends untyped) |
| D19 | wai | P2 | H | Per-commit log digest (SE-1): definition, and whether the host or the engine commits it | requirements SE-1, open question 8; surfaced by P05 | Digest vectors; `#logDigests` cell proof | decisions_for_architect.md #19 (recommends engine commits lag-one in `#logDigests`, id 5) |
| D20 | proposed | P2 | Q | Arkiv lookups by hash: Arkiv keeps no store of its own, and segment rows are reachable only by `(segment, ordinal)`. Which of block-by-hash, transaction-by-hash, receipt-by-transaction and log filtering Arkiv needs, and as which records and attributes. `#rootIndex` serves block-by-hash only if the block hash is `GlobalRoot` | Reconciliation 2026-09-30 (A4 sign-off) | Record/attribute layout per lookup, with its commitment and history cost | design.md §11 The Model; What This Assumes of the Schema |

### Product decisions

Kind K4. The product owner decides.

Status **wai** means "waiting on additional input".

| ID | Status | Decision | Sources | Owner | Default if undecided | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P08 | wai | Must the live DSL's standalone `!=` / `!` (negation-only queries) survive into v0.1? The answer also records which `!=` semantics the live DSL has (SQL- or MongoDB-style), the input to D01 1.5 | `arkiv-live-product.md` query language; requirements OQ6; surfaced by D01 | Product | Live-set index term adopted (D01 1.1-B/1.2-B): users have the capability today | decisions_for_architect.md *Product questions answerable from the live product*; flips D01 1.1/1.2 and drops one `[API]` change |
| P09 | wai | Glob `~`: general glob, prefix-only, or dropped? | `arkiv-live-product.md`; target draft "no glob" | Product | Prefix-only: literal + one trailing wildcard → §5 prefix scan; else `InvalidQuery` | same section; one sentence in D01 |

### Structure

Kind K3.

| ID | Status | Pri | Change | Sources | Acceptance check | Link |

| S05 | triaged | P1 | Normative-surface appendix: everything that changes the root if changed, and the explicit list of what is free | F-B10, F-Athena, R26 | One list; D09 vectors reference it | design.md Appendix A (started 2026-10-01 with the D18 statement) |
| S06 | triaged | P2 | Overview document: goals, non-goals, assumptions (D13), building blocks, component diagram, life of a write, life of a query, invariants | R1–R4, R20 | Rubric set-level checklist passes |  |
| S07 | triaged | P1 | Filter-evaluation section (output of D01) | F-A1 | Section exists |  |
| S08 | triaged | P1 | Recovery, reorg and failure document (output of D02–D04) with "things that can go wrong" table | R12, R22 | Table exists; each row has detection + handling |  |

Until then the short document lags this one and must not be cited as current | Triage 2026-09-25; programme Phase 3 step 14 |  |
| T04 | open | Port the "Empty user records are legal" paragraph from branch `matthiaszimmermann/feat/docs-metering` into design.md §3 when that branch is rebased onto the v2 adoption (it conflicts on the `recordID 42 → 100` line it follows) | Reconciliation 2026-09-30 | design.md §3 Record Identity |

Owed: D19 digest, D05 shard-mark survival | design.md §11; §4 catalogue |
| P06 | K4 | "Full history" promise (§1 property 5) vs. retention window with archival nodes | A-Elena, A-D07 | decided: **by requirement DI-7 / CS-5**: minimum window is an instance parameter; consensus path refuses beyond it on every node; archival surface separate. History's *tier* remains the requirements' own open question 2 (product). Text landed 2026-10-01 | design.md §1 property 5 (renamed "History within a retention window"); §4 `#params` `#minRetention` (u64, commits); §7 retention note |
| P07 | K4 | Is a second conformant engine a goal? (decides whether D18 is contract or choice) | F-Athena, A-Marcus | decided: **yes, by requirement** (swappability; NF-8 commitment vectors; DI-2 engine state under the root) — so the §4 layout is *normative*, the opposite of the programme's default. D18 = A. Text landed with D18, 2026-10-01 | design.md Appendix A Normative Surface |

## Triage log

- **2026-10-01 (D01 1.5).** New D01 sub-question 1.5: does a negated literal match records where the
  cell is absent or of another type? This is MongoDB-style `$ne` versus SQL-style `<>`, which
  excludes NULL. The brief had assumed MongoDB-style implicitly, in 1.1's semantics row and fixture
  Q3, without posing it as a choice. The question exists whatever P08 decides, since
  `a=1 AND NOT b=2` raises it too. Recommendation: MongoDB-style, which comes free from the
  posting-list mechanism, whereas SQL-style needs an unbounded union or per-name existence terms.
  The exception is a SQL-style live DSL combined with P08 requiring exact compatibility. P08's
  answer now also records the live DSL's `!=` semantics.
- **2026-10-01 (D18 applied).** D18's statement ("the commitment binds the engine's bookkeeping; a
  conformant engine reproduces the `GlobalRoot`, so §2–§4 and §8 are normative byte for byte") opens
  a new design **Appendix A — Normative Surface**, marked "being assembled (S05)", with a pointer
  sentence in §8. That meets D18's acceptance check as written; D18 and P07 are closed. S05 stays
  open to complete the list, which waits on D09. The "Decided, text not yet applied" section is empty
  and removed.
- **2026-10-01 (P06 applied).** P06's text landed: §1 property 5 is renamed "History within a
  retention window" and promises history only within the window, with a uniform consensus-path
  refusal beyond it and an archival surface for longer history. `#params` gains `#minRetention`
  (`u64`, **commits**), taking the minimum-window half of D05 5.2 ahead of the rest of D05. Because
  the reserved layout is normative (D18), this is a contract change. P06 is closed; D05 stays open
  for the archival surface, `retention()` and 5.3–5.7. The window's length is still the
  requirements' OQ2 (product).
- **2026-10-01 (briefs review).** `decisions_for_architect.md` added to this directory and checked
  against the register: all 19 D rows present in both with the same IDs, priorities and brief
  numbers; every design section the briefs cite resolves in the adopted design. Corrections:
  **D02** is back to `waiting_on_additional_input`. Only 2.1 is decided (not in v1); the brief's
  revised recommendation specifies 2.2 and 2.3 now, and D05 and D11 depend on them. This corrects
  the 2026-09-30 entry below, which marked all of D02 deferred. **D18** is `accepted` (A, by
  requirement via P07); text owed. The D01, D02 and D05 summaries now match the revised briefs.
  D16 now names the three texts its outcome changes, including F26's caption. Not tracked here
  yet: the briefs' product questions OQ2 (sets `#minRetention`, blocks D05) and OQ5; the product
  table's P02, P04 and P05 still read "decided" where this register has them done; D20 has no
  brief.
- **2026-09-30 (reconciliation).** The v2 text of design.md (all rows above marked done, through
  G5) was compared line by line with the previous design.md at `66e83d6`, and adopted as design.md.
  The six edits that change committed bytes or engine behaviour were signed off individually:
  **F09** (`#alloc` in the net diff, covered by the root; v1 contradicted its own §2, §4 and §10
  overlay table), **F13** (retyping per write, as the API already states), **F08** (a failed call
  applies nothing; frame rollback is the host's decision), **P05 / F10 / D19** (§11 adopted: the API
  already exposes `immutable_data_*`; id 4 and the `#params` fields were already specified in v1's
  §11; id 5 stays reserved for `#logDigests`), **P02 / P01** (no admin path for `#params` or the
  segment set) and **F16** (ABCI 2.0 mapping). All accepted. The comparison produced fix rows
  F19–F28, landed together as G6 in the adoption PR rather than in PRs of at most five, since
  they are one-hunk consistency fixes to the same text. **Arkiv stores all of its state and block
  data in Golem DB** (confirmed 2026-09-30), so §11 is on Arkiv's critical path: new row D20
  (lookups by hash), and a proposed priority raise for T01, T02, D03, D05, D17 and D19, not yet
  applied to their rows. The metering branch's §3 paragraph is outside both texts: T04.
  A spot check of the rows marked done found two gaps, now fixed: §4's status line missed D09 and
  D19 (F29), and the API still listed `rewind` as an operation (F30). **`rewind(to)` is confirmed
  not in v1**, so D02 is deferred; its semantics remain for a later version. F02 and F03 are done
  by text only: their fixture and Astra C3 checks need `conformance/vectors/`, which does not exist
  yet.
- **2026-09-25 (K4).** P01, P02, P04, P05, P06, P07 resolved against the requirements document
  (`arkiv-source-of-truth/golem-db.md`) rather than by a product meeting: each is answered by a
  cited requirement (CS-5, SE-1, DI-7, DI-2, NF-8, genericity principle). P03 stays defaulted.
  Consequences: §11 is adopted (SE-1) and owes a per-commit digest — new row D19; the reserved
  layout is normative (D18 = A, alternative withdrawn); D05 revised to a `#minRetention` instance
  parameter with a separate archival surface; D02 revised to "semantics specified, feature
  deployment-optional and not in v1" per the requirements' open question 4; D13 admits the one
  node-local cap DI-4 permits (open-branch count). Seven brief/requirement conflicts are tabulated
  in `decisions_for_architect.md`.
- **2026-09-25.** Kinds confirmed as registered; no row contested. K1 (F01–F18) and the Phase 1
  skeleton rows (S02, S03, S04, S12) accepted as a batch. F13 verified against the API: "a `set` may
  change kind and/or type". K4 rows stay with their stated defaults until an owner is named; a
  default applied in text is marked *defaulted, not decided*. S01 (target shape) deferred to the end
  of Phase 2: Phases 1–2 land in the current file under either shape, and the size of D01–D09
  output is the best evidence for the choice.
