//! Reversible cell working state for GolemDB write branches.
//!
//! [`Branches`] opens head-only branches and validates IDs for every read,
//! write, checkpoint, rollback, seal, commit, discard, and `branch_info` call. Each operation uses one storage
//! snapshot for both its head check and cell reads. The manager is cloneable;
//! clones share the registry, with operations serialized per branch.
//!
//! The private cell overlay keeps puts and tombstones in memory, reads through
//! to the validated origin snapshot, and groups changes into atomic operations
//! and checkpoint frames. Public [`CellRead`] and [`CellWrite`] views provide
//! access only within manager callbacks. Scans match encoded cell-key prefixes.
//! Seal applies the final cell diff and derived index postings to buffered
//! storage, computes both roots, and freezes the branch without durable writes.
//!
//! Genesis initialization, history, and database rewind are not implemented yet.
//! Record validation, bindings, and allocation belong to record operations;
//! their cell writes participate in the same undo journal as ordinary cells.
//!
//! # Guarded branch access
//!
//! The database must already have an initialized `Superblock/head`. This layer
//! never fabricates genesis. Reads return owned values or collect scans inside
//! the callback so they cannot outlive the head check's snapshot.

//! # Sealing
//!
//! Supply the deployment's hash provider when constructing the manager. A seal
//! reopens both roots from the validated origin, adds the previous commit's
//! `#roots` cell, applies cells, derives postings from actual before/after values,
//! and applies the index. No database writer is opened. History is deferred.
//! The result retains both updates and physical rows for commit.
//!
//! ```

//! use golemdb_merkle::{HashProvider, Keccak256Hasher};
//! use golemdb_storage::{Database, MemoryDatabase, Table, WriteTransaction};
//!
//! let db = MemoryDatabase::new();
//! let hash = Keccak256Hasher;
//! // Minimal empty-head fixture, not a production genesis initializer.
//! let mut tx = db.begin_write()?;
//! let empty = hash.hash(&[]);
//! tx.put(Table("Superblock"), b"head", &[0u64.to_be_bytes().as_slice(), &empty, &empty].concat())?;
//! tx.commit()?;
//! let branches = Branches::new(db, hash)?;
//! let branch = branches.begin()?;
//! let sealed = branches.seal(branch)?;
//! assert_eq!(sealed.commit_id, 1);
//! assert_eq!(sealed.cells.changed_cells.len(), 1); // The lag-one #roots cell.
//! assert!(sealed.index.changed_terms.is_empty());
//! assert!(branches.branch_info(branch)?.sealed);
//! assert_eq!(branches.head()?, 0); // Seal does not publish.
//! assert_eq!(branches.commit(branch)?, 1);
//! assert_eq!(branches.head()?, 1);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//! Repeated seal calls return the cached result after another head check.
//! Sealed branches reject cell reads/writes, checkpoints, and rollback; metadata,
//! commit, and discard remain available. An error or unwinding panic during
//! computation leaves the branch open with its overlay, version, and frames unchanged.

//! # Committing
//!
//! `commit(branch)` seals an open branch automatically, or reuses its existing
//! seal. It opens one storage writer, rechecks head, replays the buffered rows,
//! and advances head atomically. A successful commit consumes the branch ID;
//! other branches over the old head become stale. A reader already holding a
//! committed snapshot continues to see that snapshot.
//!
//! A seal error leaves the branch open. A storage error after sealing preserves
//! the sealed result for retry or discard; every retry validates head again.
//! The manager does not recompute roots for a sealed branch. History and
//! change-set tables remain deferred; record-layer allocator/binding writes
//! already staged as cells are persisted with all other sealed rows.
