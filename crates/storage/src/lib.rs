//! Transactional, byte-ordered key/value storage for GolemDB.
//!
//! Transactions span all tables. Readers retain a committed snapshot;
//! a writer sees its own changes and publishes them atomically on commit. Drop
//! aborts an uncommitted writer.
//!
//! [`MemoryDatabase`] is the initial backend. The traits intentionally expose
//! owned bytes and no backend-specific handles or threading requirements.
//! The separate `golemdb-storage-mdbx` crate implements these traits for MDBX.
//!
//! ```
//! use golemdb_storage::{Database, MemoryDatabase, ReadCursor, ReadTransaction,
//!     Table, WriteTransaction, scan_prefix};
//!
//! let terms = Table("Index");
//! let db = MemoryDatabase::new();
//! let snapshot = db.begin_read()?;
//! let mut tx = db.begin_write()?;
//! tx.put(terms, b"name\0Alice", b"root")?;
//! tx.commit()?;
//! assert_eq!(snapshot.get(terms, b"name\0Alice")?, None);
//! let latest = db.begin_read()?;
//! let mut cursor = latest.cursor(terms, b"name\0Alice")?;
//! assert_eq!(cursor.next()?.unwrap().1, b"root");
