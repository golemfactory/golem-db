//! Public Rust contracts for GolemDB record CRUD and branch lifecycle.
//!
//! [`Api`] is the synchronous facade contract for CRUD and branch operations.
//! Consumers can use `Arc<dyn Api + Send + Sync>`; builders accept explicit cell values.
//! All results own their data and expose no storage transaction or cell writer.
//!
//! [`Database`] implements Api on a cloneable handle with a shared branch registry.
//! Its constructors initialize or validate genesis and select the configured hash.
//! These contracts are unmetered: no budget, receipt, debug flag, or record version.
//! Current record storage supports branch reads and committed-head reads only.
//! Immutable-data types and methods are exposed, but every such Database call
//! returns [`ApiError::NotImplemented`] immediately without I/O or state changes.
//!
//! ```
//! use golemdb_api::{Api, CellLimits, CellValue, Genesis, Database,
//!     HashAlgorithm, OpenConfig, ReadTarget, RecordOp, RecordKey};
//!
//! let config = OpenConfig::new(Genesis::new(HashAlgorithm::Keccak256, CellLimits {
//!         max_cell_name_len: 32, max_str_len: 64, max_bytes_len: 128,
//! }));
//! let db = Database::open_memory(&config.genesis)?;
//! let branch = db.begin()?;
//! let key = RecordKey([0x42; 32]);
//! db.create(branch, RecordOp::create(key)
//!     .attribute("price", CellValue::from_i32(50))?
//!     .field("description", CellValue::from_str("A product"))?)?;
//! let pending = db.clone().get(ReadTarget::Branch(branch), RecordOp::get(key))?;
//! assert_eq!(pending.cells[b"price".as_slice()].as_i32(), Some(50));
//! let commit = db.commit(branch)?;
//! assert_eq!(commit.get(), 1);
//! assert_eq!(db.get(ReadTarget::Head, RecordOp::get(key))?, pending);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
